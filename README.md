# MBS example monorepo
In this directory we have "dummy" examples.

Components and toolchains are kept as simple / stupid as possible so that we can focus on the core concepts, without the "noise" of a full featured production ready thing.

So, to be clear, don't expect to see the full feature production ready example of a toolchain recipe for language-x.
